"""
Bronze quality — the quarantine pattern, applied to all 7 bronze tables.

Taught in depth, in the lecture, on two tables: bronze_orders (CDC) and
bronze_products (file-based). The remaining five follow the exact same shape —
only the rules differ, based on each table's own fields. Code here is complete
for all seven; nothing is left as an exercise.

Why this sits ON TOP of bronze, not inside it: bronze_orders, bronze_products,
and every other bronze table (built in L4/L5) keep their existing contract —
exactly what arrived, untouched. This file reads from those existing bronze
tables and adds quality tagging as a separate step, so ingestion code never has
to know quality rules exist, and quality rules can evolve independently.

Why expect_all, not expect_all_or_drop or expect_all_or_fail: a hard fail halts
the whole pipeline over one bad row. A silent drop loses that row without anyone
noticing — the same mistake as the referential-integrity lesson from L1.
expect_all keeps every row and simply tags it — nothing lost, nothing blocked.

Scope — structural checks only, not business checks: every rule below is
checkable on a single row, in isolation. Business and semantic rules —
deduplication, SCD Type 2 correctness, cross-table referential integrity —
need more context than one row can offer, and belong in Silver (Module 3).

PUBLISHING, corrected after live testing: the *_quality_check tagging table is
private=True on purpose — nothing outside this pipeline needs to see the raw
tagging step. But *_valid and *_quarantined are deliberately NOT private and
NOT plain @dp.view — both private tables and views are pipeline-scoped and
cannot be read from another pipeline, or from Databricks SQL, dashboards, or
alerts. Silver runs as its own separate pipeline (stepright-transformation-
pipeline) starting Module 3, and quarantine monitoring in L19 runs outside any
pipeline entirely — both need *_valid and *_quarantined to be real, published
Unity Catalog tables, readable via spark.read.table("dev.stepright.<name>")
from anywhere, not pipeline-internal objects.

Consumption: Silver reads from the *_valid tables below, never from bronze
directly. The *_quarantined tables are monitored — row-count trending and
spike alerting is built in L19 (DQ as code, Module 5).

Remediation: a quarantined row is never hand-edited in place. A correction
always re-enters as new data through the normal path — a new CDC update event
for CDC sources, a re-exported file for file-based sources, or a manually
curated correction batch for one-off historical fixes with no real source to
correct. See the Locked Decisions Document for the full remediation pattern.
